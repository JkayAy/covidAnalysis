# covidAnalysis

This analysis is sourced from corona data pbx downloaded from health organisation online. We extracted informations from two tables. corana deaths and vaccinations table
and i was able to concatenate these two datasets. I then simply cleans the datasets and made an exciting findings. I observed from the datasets that the correlation
between column "total_deaths" has over 80 percent with columns "people_fully_vaccinated", "people_vaccinated" and "population"

Meanwhile this datasets captures total of 244 countries accross Asia, Africa, North America and South America.
The dataset was then grouped by location and correlation done on them

I hope you do enjoy the results
